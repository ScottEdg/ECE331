From the Netmask, 6 zeros are obtained from 192 and 8 zeros from 0. A total of 14 zeros are on the end of the netmask.  This means that a total 2^14 or 16,384 address exist in this network.  Since the Network and Broadcast Addresses reside in this network, the number of available addresses is simply (2^14)-2 or 16,382.
