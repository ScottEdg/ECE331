	#ient & server.
 a) Find a good C TCP client and server tutorial. Cite your source.
	http://www.linuxhowtos.org/C_C++/socket.htm
 b) Work the tutorial and get your code both client and server to work. For your answer, state that the
tutorial is completed.
	The tutorial has been completed.
 c) In your own words, briefly explain the operation of each of the following functions:
  socket()
	socket() creates and endpoint, both on server and client sides, that allows communication between differnt machines.
  bind()
	bind() assigns an address to a socket. socket() itself only creates a namespace.
  listen()
	listen() is a server side function.  It listens for a request from a client to connect to the server.
  accept()
	accept() creates a new socket and makes a new socket file descriptor for the new socket on the server side.  The new socket is not considered to be in a listening state
  getaddrinfo()
	getaddrinfo() is exactly as it sounds.  It can get the address info of the client or server
  connect()
	connect() attempts to make a connection to a socket.  Also if the socket has not been bound (using bind()) connect() will bind it to an unused address space.
